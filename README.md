# First-Challenges
This repository contains some of the first programming challenges and little programs that I have done. 

It contains the Hangman's game in Python. It is a simple version of the game in which one has to guess a word from a hidden list of words. In this version the words correspond to names of animals, they are selected randomly each time.
